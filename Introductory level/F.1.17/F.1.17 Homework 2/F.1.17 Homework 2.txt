We need to create another section and add it to the section that you created as your previous homework. 
When positioning the portraits on the page you need to use the flex-wrap property. The template for this section is called part2.png, the template of the whole page that you will eventually have, is called full_page.png. 
All the necessary images are in the “images” folder.
